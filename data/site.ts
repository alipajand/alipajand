  "I've spent 9+ years turning messy requirements into products that work. I do frontend (React, TypeScript, Next.js) and backend (Node.js, APIs), and I care a lot about design systems, component libraries, and the tools and docs that help teams move fast.",
  "I sit between design and engineering: I make sure the code is accessible and actually ships. I've run design-system rollouts and built things like an MCP server for Cursor so we catch issues before review. I like working in small teams where everyone cares about the product.",
  "I'm good at leading, working with others, and mentoring. I care about stable releases and making hard stuff simple so everyone can contribute.",
