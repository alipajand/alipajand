export const ABOUT_PARAGRAPHS = [
  "Senior Product Engineer with 9+ years turning complex requirements into fast, reliable products. I focus on frontend (React, TypeScript, Next.js) and backend (Node.js, Python, APIs), with deep experience in design systems, component libraries, and Developer Experience—tooling, docs, and workflows that help teams ship faster.",
  "I bridge design and engineering: accessible, performant UIs; interactive and 3D/animated experiences; and production-ready code. I've driven ~30% performance gains, led design-system adoption, and introduced AI-driven automation (e.g. MCP for Cursor) for code review and velocity. I work best in agile, cross-functional teams and care about product vision and execution.",
  "What I bring: Leadership, cross-functional collaboration, mentorship, and a track record of stable releases (e.g. 99.9% deployment stability). Open to senior and staff-level roles where I can shape architecture, DX, and product quality.",
